<h1> Baseball </h1>
<h3>Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players 
each who take turns batting and fielding</h3>

<div>The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball (that is throwm
by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then running
counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and 
homeplate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and touches
the homeplate. PLayers on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher
of the fielding team, which tries to prevents runs by getting hitters out in 
several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later 
attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates' turn batting, such as 
on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever
the team records three outs.</div>

<section> <h5> One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team,
constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the 
greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end
of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock,
although most games end in the ninth inning.</h5>
